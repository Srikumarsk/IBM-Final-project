# Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview

This project implements a **predictive maintenance system** for industrial machinery using **machine learning models**, developed and deployed on **IBM Cloud**. The aim is to predict machine failures in advance by analyzing sensor data, thus reducing unplanned downtime and optimizing maintenance strategies.

##  Problem Statement

In many industrial settings, equipment failure can lead to unexpected shutdowns, costly repairs, and productivity loss. Traditional maintenance approaches are either reactive (too late) or scheduled (often unnecessary). This project introduces a **predictive maintenance solution** that uses historical and real-time sensor data to **anticipate failures** before they occur.


## Objectives

- Collect and preprocess machinery sensor data (vibration, temperature, pressure, etc.).
- Train machine learning models to classify/predict potential failures.
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Deploy the trained model on **IBM Cloud** with a basic user interface for predictions.
- Visualize data and prediction results on IBM Cloud notebooks or a deployed app.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Platform:** IBM Cloud
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Tools:** IBM Watson Studio, IBM Cloud Object Storage
- **ML Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Model Deployment:** IBM Watson Machine Learning (WML), Flask/Streamlit 
- **DevOps (Optional):** GitHub, IBM Cloud CLI
